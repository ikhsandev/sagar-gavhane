# Hello

My name is Sagar Gavhane.

Passionate software engineer with 3.6+ years of experience in building products for numerous domains like fin-tech, real estate, video streaming, retail, and now e-commerce.

Iâ€™m currently available for work, you can take a look at [my resume](https://resume.io/r/zUMxWOl6F).

I have an old blog which I no longer actively update - you probably want to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sagar_codes), [Medium](https://medium.com/@sagar_gavhane), and [Dev](https://dev.to/sagar) for more up-to-date content.

Most of my work is open source and publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sagar-gavhane).

I spend my time Tweeting, taking photographs, making art & music, and writing code. I also write about design, courage, and lack thereof.

Thank You ðŸ˜Š
